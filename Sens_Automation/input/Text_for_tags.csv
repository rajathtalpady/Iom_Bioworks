Carbohydrate Fermenter,"Many complex carbohydrates, sugars and fibre are degraded and fermented by the bacteria in the small and large intestine to produce energy as well as impact health through the metabolites produced. These functions are primarily carried out by the bacteria as we lack the enzymes needed for this function.",The effect of high carbohydrate intake reflects in high glycemic index and high glycemic load increasing the risk of metabolic disorders like Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular challenges.,"Carbohydrate-fermenting bacteria contribute to gut health and may have beneficial effects on metabolic health, immune function, and protection against aging and neurocognitive diseases.","A Low level of carbohydrate metabolism can result in reduced SCFAs, impact inflammatory response, reduce satiety hormone levels, and even influence the intestinal barrier."
Dietary Fibre Degrader,"Dietary fibres, solube and insoluble, are not broken down by human enzymes but actually passed down to the colon where the residing bacteria work on them. These bacteria thereby produce multiple metabolites(chemicals) that in turn affect gut balance, gut barrier, impacting overall health, immunity, resistence to cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and more.","However, excessive fibre fermentation/intake is seen with digestive distress ranging from constipation to diarrhoea, bloating, reduction in appetite and early satiety",A Moderate abundance of fibre fermenting bacteria indicates a healthy contribution from your microbiome to your health.,"A Low abundance of these useful bacteria adds to inflammation, non-communicable conditions and poor health outcomes."
Immunity,"The interplay between the microbiome and your immune system includes multiple interactions in a state of balance and disease. Microbial signals ensure strong intestinal barrier function, maintain gut balance and elicit a protective immune response during an infection.",A Moderate to High abundance of bacteria that enable better immunity provide protection to the body against inflammation and resistance to disease.,A Moderate to High abundance of bacteria that enable better immunity provide protection to the body against inflammation and resistence to disease.,Low immunity bacteria may have a causal role in reduced immunity contributing to development of immune-mediated conditions.
Protein Metabolism,"The interplay between the microbiome and your immune system includes multiple interactions in a state of balance and disease. Microbial signals ensure strong intestinal barrier function, maintain gut balance and elicit a protective immune response during an infection.","Imbalanced or inefficient fermentation may however lead to unfavorable health conditions, blooming of pathogens, bloating and elevation of unhealthy protein fermentation products.",A Moderate abundance of protein metabolising bacteria indicates a fair contribution from your microbiome to your health.,"A Low abundance of these useful bacteria adds to inflammation, non-communicable conditions and poor health outcomes."
Energy Producers,"Certain bacteria are responsible for breaking down complex carbohydrates, fibers, and other substrates into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other metabolites that serve as energy sources for both the host and other microbial populations.","Having a good abundance of energy producing bacteria results in more stable, consistent energy levels through the day, keeeping you bouncing and ready for life.","Having a moderate abundance of energy producing bacteria results in more stable, consistent energy levels through the day, keeeping you bouncing and ready for life.","Low energy producing bacteria can result in energy lags during the day, and disturbances to overall gut health and increased inflammation."
Lactic Acid Producer,"Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are microorganisms that can ferment carbohydrates to produce lactic acid. These bacteria produce myriad beneficial effects for human beings include, alleviation of lactose intolerance, diarrhea, peptic ulcer, stimulation of immune system, lowering cholesterol, and have antiallergic effects, and antifungal actions.","However, a High abundance of LABs has been seen in those with gut inflammation, weight gain, insulin resistence and other metabolic disorders",A Moderate abundance of these bacteria indicate good activity and protection from the bacteria towards your health,A Low abundance of these beneficial bacteria limits your body's capability to leverage the microbiome towards best health conditions.
Heart Health Influencer,"The microbes in the gut play a huge role in cardiovascular health by impacting inflammation, regulating blood pressure, production of metabolites that influence lipid metabolism, and cholesterol levels in the blood.",Your microbiome currently has a High abundance of bacteria that negatively impact Heart Health indicates a lowered protection from your microbiome.,Your microbiome currently has a Moderate abundance of bacteria that negatively impact Heart Health. This indicates limited benefit and protection from the microbiome.,You have an advantage to have a Low abundance of bacteria that negatively impact your health health.
Pathogen,Your gut microbiome has a critical role in protecting you from infections from pathogens from outside or the overgrowth of pathogens inside. They are capable of being the resistence of the body to bacteria centric infections or to the possibility of the pathogens (disease causing microbes) overtaking the body.,We see the total abundance of pathogens in your gut is High. We would encourage you to seek an opinion of a doctor if you are experiencing any symptoms that indicate inflammation or infection.,"Your microbiome currently has a Moderate abundance of bacteria that might have a negative impact on certain aspects of your health. While this may or may not imply an inflammation, we recommend being mindful and seeking a medical opinion if you experience any symptoms.",A normal human gut does house some levels of pathogens which may or may not cause any infection or inflammation. Presence of these pathogens does not necessarily imply disease. Your gut has a low abundance of pathogens.
Weight Influencer,"The gut microbiota influences food intake by regulating brain function in a number of ways, such as by contributing to the production of chemicals which plays an important role in regulating gastrointestinal function, appetite, regulate fat storage, energy harvest, inflammation & circadian rhythms.","A high abundance of these weight influencing bacteria points towards struggles and fluctuations in weight, hunger pangs or even the accumulation of fat under the skin or in the visceral zone.","While these bacteria also produce SCFAs which are known to release energy, and manage gut balance, they might hamper other efforts towards better health.",
Insulin Metabolism,"Insulin resistence is primarily the body's reduced response to insulin and is unable to take up glucose from the blood. The microbiome plays a crucial role, contributing to the patho-genesis of obesity and pre-diabetes.",A high abundance of insulin resistence bacteria shows a distinct pattern to carbohydrate metabolism and an increased movement towards metabolic challenges.,A high or moderate abundance of insulin resistence bacteria shows a distinct pattern to carbohydrate metabolism and an increased movement towards metabolic challenges.,
Probiotic,"Probiotic bacteria exert their beneficial effects through either inhibiting growth of pathogens, or production of helpful metabolites, reinforcement of gut barrier or positively modulating the immune system","A high abundance of these bacteria contributes to various health benefits in particular realted to gut function , digestive health and reducing inflammation.","A moderate to high abundance of these bacteria contributes to various health benefits in particular realted to gut function , digestive health and reducing inflammation.",A low abundance of these bacteria might imply a lack of support from the microbiome in inflammation managament and gut function.
