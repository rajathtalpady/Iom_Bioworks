Probiotic,15.23,../static/Moderate.png,Medium,"A moderate to high abundance of these bacteria contributes to various health benefits in particular realted to gut function , digestive health and reducing inflammation."
Carbohydrate Fermenter,11.98,../static/Moderate.png,Medium,"Carbohydrate-fermenting bacteria contribute to gut health and may have beneficial effects on metabolic health, immune function, and protection against aging and neurocognitive diseases."
Immunity,6.31,../static/ThumbsDown.png,Low,Low immunity bacteria may have a causal role in reduced immunity contributing to development of immune-mediated conditions.
Energy Producers,5.28,../static/ThumbsDown.png,Low,"Low energy producing bacteria can result in energy lags during the day, and disturbances to overall gut health and increased inflammation."
