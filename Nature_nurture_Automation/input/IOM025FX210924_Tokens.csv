",Prevotella,../static/Graphs/1_initial.png,../static/Graphs/1_optimised.png,"Having a Prevotella-rich gut microbiome possibly indicates weight loss, decreases cholesterol levels, and limits the bifidogenic effect in individuals consuming a fibre-rich diet. When in high abundance though, Prevotella is known to cause sleep disturbances. These can make your circadian rhythm(sleep cycle) erratic possibly leaving you tired during the day. ",Dialister,../static/Graphs/2_initial.png,../static/Graphs/2_optimised.png,"Dialister is often seen associated with gut imbalance and inflammation. The end products of this fella are usually seen in conditions not best.Due to this and to enable optimisation of other SEnS bacteria, we recommend reducing the abundance in your gut",Megamonas,../static/Graphs/3_initial.png,../static/Graphs/3_optimised.png,Megamonas species can ferment glucose into acetate and propionate. The bacteria are seen associated with weight challenges and reduced physical exercise.The bacteria is being reduced to enable and enhance the diversity of the SEnS aiding bacteria in your gut.,Sutterella,../static/Graphs/4_initial.png,../static/Graphs/4_optimised.png,"These bacteria are largely called  ""commensals"" or those that dont have significant interaction with you. They have been also called mildly pro-inflammatory in some cases. Sutterella are seen to negatively impact sleep quality. The Iom optimiser suggests reducing this one for good rest and recovery.",Ruminococcus,../static/Graphs/5_initial.png,../static/Graphs/5_optimised.png,"One of the useful guys, this bacteria breaks down complex polysaccharides and fibre into nutrients for you. These butyrate producing bacteria however are seen increased in those who battle weighty issues. Apart from the good health an increased Ruminococcus provides, it ensures your low phases and stress levels are better managed while also upping your energy quotient! This also enhances sleep quality. ",Bifidobacterium,../static/Graphs/6_initial.png,../static/Graphs/6_optimised.png,"These probiotic, immunity enhancing bacteria live in your intestines and help body fight diarrhea, constipation, and other intestinal disorders. Your performance is defined by your SEnS. Increase your Bifidobacterium to ensure that every game is a win. This bacteria helps your battle with anxiety as well as pushes sleep quality and heightens energy levels.",Faecalibacterium,../static/Graphs/7_initial.png,../static/Graphs/7_optimised.png,"A good bacteria with a prebiotic impact on your gut, Faecalibacterium is an important fella that produces butyrate, and propionate, maintains gut equilibrium, and good gut health. Along with enabling the energy production process, Faecalibacterium are great sleep enhancers. Increasing this one to better your sleep quality and lower any anxiety you deal with. ",Roseburia,../static/Graphs/8_initial.png,../static/Graphs/8_optimised.png,"This pretty lady is a good friend to have. They are part of bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, affecting colonic motility, immunity, anti-inflammatory properties and a lean biomarker built-in. Iom recommends fortifying this bacteria to ensure your moods stay up, your stress levels are in your control and you have the energy to achieve your dreams. ",Dorea,../static/Graphs/9_initial.png,../static/Graphs/9_optimised.png,"This sweet sounding bacteria behaves as per its surrounding bacteria and nutrients.  Mostly it is involved in degrading the mucin in the gut. And it is seen that Dorea  aids your cardiovascular health.The bacteria is associated with a high fibre diet and all the good that goes with it. Consequently it aids vitality, drives energy metabolites in your gut, elevates sleep quality and reduces anxiety.",kapha-pitta,kapha,Those with Kapha Dosha generally fall asleep easily and for medium duration. This might result in daytime sleepiness and low energy levels. Stress manifests in Kapha people as increased sluggishness and disenchantment.,pitta,An imbalance of Pitta makes you more prone to disturbed sleep with intermittent dreams. This would imply a reduced feeling of being rested during the day. An imbalance might cause you to have angry outbursts as a result of stress.,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,/home/azureuser/mycontainer/Iom_16s_analysis/Analysis_output/MiBiome_Group_1_11122024/AWS_Runs/Split_Output/IOM025FX210924/Analysis/Token_Make/SEnS_appendix.csv,Paryushan Jain,,,,,,,,
