Contributing to the immune system, they enable expelling toxins and fighting pathogens. Iom recommends reducing this bacteria for helping you manage your stress and anxiety more efficiently. Even while they are helping your body, their levels are seen impacting anxiety.",Streptococcus,../static/Graphs/1_initial.png,../static/Graphs/1_optimised.png,"The term streptococcus refers to its shape of a twisted berry. While some species are commonly known to cause infections, other species are probiotics and enable better absorption of nutrients, break down food and fight off bad guys. To ensure that those bacteria that aid your SEnS are encouraged, this ambivalent bacteria is reduced. ",Acidaminococcus,../static/Graphs/2_initial.png,../static/Graphs/2_optimised.png,"These bacteria enable the break down of amino acid in your gut. Amino acids are degraded primarily to break down, use and convert to glucose nitrogen and expel the excess. However, they might be cramping the bacteria good for your SEnS factor. To make some room for those guys, Iom suggests bringing these guys a notch. ",Subdoligranulum,../static/Graphs/3_initial.png,../static/Graphs/3_optimised.png,"Abundance of Subdoligranulum is seen correlated positively with microbial richness and HDL-cholesterol levels and negatively correlated with fat mass, adipocyte diameter, insulin resistance, levels of leptin, insulin, CRP, and IL6. However, Iom optimiser reduces this bacteria imperciptably to encourage further richness  more balance in your gut. ",Butyricicoccus,../static/Graphs/4_initial.png,../static/Graphs/4_optimised.png,"Butyrate, an essential Short Chain Fatty Acid, is essential for maintaining gastrointestinal health. And Butyricoccus is one butyrate producing bacteria that is being considered as a next generation prebiotic. Iom recommends reducing the abundance of this bacteria as it might not aid your managing of down swings or stress situations",Lactobacillus,../static/Graphs/5_initial.png,../static/Graphs/5_optimised.png,"These well-recognized bacteria perform a host of vital functions from breaking down the nutrients in your food to providing immunity.These bacteria, while being great for gut health, are also beneficial for aiding and abetting your stress management capabilities. And, grandma was possibly right- this bacteria helps better sleep. Iom recommends increasing this one for you.",Bifidobacterium,../static/Graphs/6_initial.png,../static/Graphs/6_optimised.png,"These probiotic, immunity enhancing bacteria live in your intestines and help body fight diarrhea, constipation, and other intestinal disorders. Your performance is defined by your SEnS. Increase your Bifidobacterium to ensure that every game is a win. This bacteria helps your battle with anxiety as well as pushes sleep quality and heightens energy levels.",Roseburia,../static/Graphs/7_initial.png,../static/Graphs/7_optimised.png,"This pretty lady is a good friend to have. They are part of bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, affecting colonic motility, immunity, anti-inflammatory properties and a lean biomarker built-in. Iom recommends fortifying this bacteria to ensure your moods stay up, your stress levels are in your control and you have the energy to achieve your dreams. ",Ruminococcus,../static/Graphs/8_initial.png,../static/Graphs/8_optimised.png,"One of the useful guys, this bacteria breaks down complex polysaccharides and fibre into nutrients for you. These butyrate producing bacteria however are seen increased in those who battle weighty issues. Apart from the good health an increased Ruminococcus provides, it ensures your low phases and stress levels are better managed while also upping your energy quotient! This also enhances sleep quality. ",Dorea,../static/Graphs/9_initial.png,../static/Graphs/9_optimised.png,"This sweet sounding bacteria behaves as per its surrounding bacteria and nutrients.  Mostly it is involved in degrading the mucin in the gut. And it is seen that Dorea  aids your cardiovascular health.The bacteria is associated with a high fibre diet and all the good that goes with it. Consequently it aids vitality, drives energy metabolites in your gut, elevates sleep quality and reduces anxiety.",kapha-pitta,kapha,Those with Kapha Dosha generally fall asleep easily and for medium duration. This might result in daytime sleepiness and low energy levels. Stress manifests in Kapha people as increased sluggishness and disenchantment.,pitta,An imbalance of Pitta makes you more prone to disturbed sleep with intermittent dreams. This would imply a reduced feeling of being rested during the day. An imbalance might cause you to have angry outbursts as a result of stress.,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,/home/azureuser/mycontainer/Iom_16s_analysis/Analysis_output/MiBiome_Group_1_11122024/AWS_Runs/Split_Output/IOM032FX101024/Analysis/Token_Make/SEnS_appendix.csv,Rajee Pradeepkumar,,,,,,,,
