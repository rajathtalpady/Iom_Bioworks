",Prevotella,../static/Graphs/1_initial.png,../static/Graphs/1_optimised.png,"Having a Prevotella-rich gut microbiome possibly indicates weight loss, decreases cholesterol levels, and limits the bifidogenic effect in individuals consuming a fibre-rich diet. When in high abundance though, Prevotella is known to cause sleep disturbances. These can make your circadian rhythm(sleep cycle) erratic possibly leaving you tired during the day. ",Fusicatenibacter,../static/Graphs/2_initial.png,../static/Graphs/2_optimised.png,"A very common gut bacteria, Fusicatenibacter is a happy sugar fermenter with anti inflammatory properties. And in the process of this fermentation they produce the good SCFAs-butyrate and propionate for you. However, this bacteria might be pulling your gut away from peaceful sleep. Iom recommends reducing this bacteria to enhance your sleep quality",Enterococcus,../static/Graphs/3_initial.png,../static/Graphs/3_optimised.png,"Enterococcus are super interesting bacteria that play a major role in aroma and ripening of cheese. These slightly controversial guys are sometimes, probiotic, and active against pathogens. Yet they are antibiotic resistent and seen in nosocomial infections. In the SEnS relevance, these bacteria are shown to move stress levels and fatigue in undesirable directions. Iom recommends reducing the abundance to encourage energy levels and better moods.   ",Citrobacter,../static/Graphs/4_initial.png,../static/Graphs/4_optimised.png,"Citrobacters are known to be pathogens, though rarely the primary cause of illness. They have however been isolated from urionary and respiratory infections. This bacteria is negatively affecting your sleep quality. To enable your sleep  to be better and reduce the number of times you might wake in the night, Iom suggests reducing this one for you. ",Bifidobacterium,../static/Graphs/5_initial.png,../static/Graphs/5_optimised.png,"These probiotic, immunity enhancing bacteria live in your intestines and help body fight diarrhea, constipation, and other intestinal disorders. Your performance is defined by your SEnS. Increase your Bifidobacterium to ensure that every game is a win. This bacteria helps your battle with anxiety as well as pushes sleep quality and heightens energy levels.",Dorea,../static/Graphs/6_initial.png,../static/Graphs/6_optimised.png,"This sweet sounding bacteria behaves as per its surrounding bacteria and nutrients.  Mostly it is involved in degrading the mucin in the gut. And it is seen that Dorea  aids your cardiovascular health.The bacteria is associated with a high fibre diet and all the good that goes with it. Consequently it aids vitality, drives energy metabolites in your gut, elevates sleep quality and reduces anxiety.",Ruminococcus,../static/Graphs/7_initial.png,../static/Graphs/7_optimised.png,"One of the useful guys, this bacteria breaks down complex polysaccharides and fibre into nutrients for you. These butyrate producing bacteria however are seen increased in those who battle weighty issues. Apart from the good health an increased Ruminococcus provides, it ensures your low phases and stress levels are better managed while also upping your energy quotient! This also enhances sleep quality. ",Anaerostipes,../static/Graphs/8_initial.png,../static/Graphs/8_optimised.png,Anaerostipes -an-earo-stipes are those friends in us who break down plant and fruit sugars and Vitamin B into propionate and acetate-both beneficial to your health. The bacteria aids better balancing glucose at fasting levels.The focus on maximising your every day with appropriate energy levels and keeping depression away can be helped by increasing the levels of Anaerostipes,Parabacteroides,../static/Graphs/9_initial.png,../static/Graphs/9_optimised.png,"This genus, also a common resident of the gut, like other major genera, is instrumental to your overall health, immunity and influences your weight. Some species under this group are being considered as next generation probiotics too  for their therapeutic intestinal balance abilities. Parabacteroides also act as your personal protector against stress and anxiety. An increased abundance is good for lowered stress levels",pitta-kapha,pitta,An imbalance of Pitta makes you more prone to disturbed sleep with intermittent dreams. This would imply a reduced feeling of being rested during the day. An imbalance might cause you to have angry outbursts as a result of stress.,kapha,Those with Kapha Dosha generally fall asleep easily and for medium duration. This might result in daytime sleepiness and low energy levels. Stress manifests in Kapha people as increased sluggishness and disenchantment.,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,/home/azureuser/mycontainer/Iom_16s_analysis/Analysis_output/MiBiome_Group_1_20112024/AWS_Runs/Split_Output/IOM119F130723/Analysis/Token_Make/SEnS_appendix.csv,Ish Jain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
